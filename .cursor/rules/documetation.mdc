## Database Schema Design
Database Schema Design for A.U.R.A.

This document details the logical database schema for the A.U.R.A. project, structured according to the Medallion Data Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). This approach ensures data quality, traceability, and optimal readiness for analytical reporting, AI model training, and real-time decision-making. While the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) may initially utilize file-based storage (e.g., local CSVs, in-memory pandas DataFrames) due to its "skip database for now" directive, this schema is designed to be fully compatible with a scalable cloud-based data lakehouse environment (e.g., AWS S3 + Spark/Databricks, or a managed data warehouse like Google BigQuery or Snowflake) for future scalability and persistence.

### 5. Data Flow and Transformation Summary

*   **Bronze Ingestion:** Raw, unsanitized data from CRM, Billing, Web Analytics, Customer Support, and Survey platforms is loaded into their respective Bronze tables. This process captures full fidelity, including timestamps and source metadata.
*   **Bronze → Silver Transformation (ETL/ELT Pipeline):**
    *   **Data Quality:** Automated processes handle nulls, duplicates, data type mismatches, and format inconsistencies.
    *   **Standardization:** Categorical values are harmonized (e.g., "Male" instead of "male", "M").
    *   **Enrichment & Integration:** Different Bronze tables are joined using `customer_id` to create comprehensive customer profiles and aggregated facts (e.g., linking customer demographics with their engagement events). Basic NLP might extract sentiment from `transcript_text` and `comments`.
    *   **Derived Metrics:** Initial, foundational metrics such as `total_lifetime_revenue`, `avg_transaction_value`, and daily/monthly activity counts are calculated.
*   **Silver → Gold Transformation (Feature Engineering & Business Logic):**
    *   **Dashboard KPIs:** Silver layer aggregates are further transformed and combined to produce high-level KPIs and client-specific summary metrics for the `gold_overall_kpi_dashboard_view` and `gold_customer_360_dashboard_view`.
    *   **AI Feature Engineering:** Complex feature engineering processes combine various Silver layer facts and dimensions to create the predictive features required for AI models (e.g., `feature_avg_daily_active_events_90d`, `feature_days_since_last_login`).
    *   **AI Model Inference & Decision Engine Output:** The results from the AI models (e.g., `predicted_churn_probability`) and the rule-based decision engine (e.g., `churn_risk_level`, `recommended_action`) are written into `gold_customer_360_dashboard_view` for immediate business consumption.
    *   **Chatbot Context Generation:** Specific summaries, key insights, and relevant playbook strategies are extracted and pre-computed for the `gold_ai_chatbot_context` table, optimizing chatbot response times and relevance.

9.  **AI Chatbot UI/UX Principles**

    The AI chatbot is a strategic partner, guiding users to insights and actions. Its UI/UX should reflect its intelligence and utility.

    *   **Conversational Flow:**
        *   Natural language processing (NLP) should be supported by clear, concise responses.
        *   The chatbot should proactively ask clarifying questions or offer suggestions to guide the user.
    *   **Visual Feedback:**
        *   Use typing indicators to show the chatbot is processing.
        *   Differentiate user input from AI responses (e.g., different message bubble colors/alignment).
        *   Clear "loading" states for data retrieval.
    *   **Proactive Suggestions:**
        *   Offer "quick replies" or suggested questions/actions based on the current context or identified user needs.
        *   Example: "Show me top churn risks" or "Simulate impact of a discount."
    *   **Data Integration:**
        *   Seamlessly present data snippets, small charts, or direct links to relevant dashboard sections within the chat interface.
        *   Recommendations (e.g., retention strategies) should be clearly presented and actionable, potentially with direct links to execute actions.
    *   **Context Retention:** The chatbot should remember previous interactions to maintain a coherent conversation and avoid repetitive questions.
    *   **Consistency with Brand:** The chatbot interface should integrate seamlessly with the overall A.U.R.A platform, using the defined color palette, typography, and iconography.

10. **Accessibility**

    A.U.R.A is committed to creating an accessible platform for all users.

    *   **Color Contrast:** All text and essential UI elements must meet `WCAG AA standards` for color contrast.

    *   **Fluid Layouts:** Utilize fluid grids and flexible images to adapt gracefully to different viewports.
    *   **Breakpoints:** Define key breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop, large desktop) to optimize layouts for each device category.
    *   **Prioritization:** On smaller screens, prioritize essential information and actions, potentially collapsing secondary content or navigation.
    *   **Touch Targets:** Ensure interactive elements (buttons, links) have adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users.
    *   **Performance:** Optimize assets and code for fast loading times on mobile networks.
